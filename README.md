Analysis of ensemble techniques on tree-based classifiers and SVM for breast cancer classification

In this project I am going to analyse some of the topics examined in ”Mathematics in Machine Learning” course offered at Politecnico di Torino, M.Sc. in Data Science and Engineering. I will build a binary classification model for predicting whether a breast mass is malignant or benign based on Breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset. In  particular, I will focus on the bias-variance trade-off and how ensemble techniques such as Bagging, Random Forest and  Adaptive Boosting used on tree-based classifiers and Support Vector Machines can handle it. All the steps of the data pipeline will be explored, including data pre-processing, features selection, Principal Component Analisys and Singular Value Decomposition, algorithms’ details and implementation and, finally, the results.
